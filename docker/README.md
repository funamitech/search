### Running a docker container

Dockerized librey is a way to provide users with yet another way to self-host their own projects with a view to privacy. If you wish to help, please start by looking for bugs in used docker configurations.

### Running a Docker container through ghcr

To run librey in a docker container, you can simply use the command:

```sh
docker run -d \
  --name librey \
  -e TZ="America/New_York" \
  -e CONFIG_GOOGLE_DOMAIN="com" \
  -e CONFIG_GOOGLE_LANGUAGE="en" \
  -e CONFIG_WIKIPEDIA_LANGUAGE="en" \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  ghcr.io/ahwxorg/librey:latest
```

Also run with watchtower for auto-updating: (optional)
```sh
docker run -d \
  --name librey-watchtower-1 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  containrrr/watchtower
```

<br>

### Running a Docker container with composer

```yml

  librey:
    image: ghcr.io/ahwxorg/librey:latest
    container_name: librey
    network_mode: bridge

      - CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION=true
    volumes:
      - ./nginx_logs:/var/log/nginx
      - ./php_logs:/var/log/php7
    restart: unless-stopped
  watchtower: # Watchtower is not required but highly recommended, since Watchtower will re-pull and restart the LibreY container automatically whenever there's an update.
    image: containrrr/watchtower
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock

### Docker version issues

If you are going to build your own docker image based on this repository, pay attention to your Docker version, because depending on how recent the installed version is, maybe you should use the `buildx` command instead of `build`.

Docker <= 20.10: `docker build`

Docker > 20.10: `docker buildx build`

<br>

### Building a docker image

If you don't want to use the image that is already available on `docker hub`, then you can simply build the Dockerfile directly from the github repository using the command:

```sh
docker build https://github.com/Ahwxorg/librey.git -t librey:latest
```

```sh
docker run -d --name librey \
    -e CONFIG_GOOGLE_DOMAIN="com" \
    -e CONFIG_GOOGLE_LANGUAGE="en" \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    librey:latest
```

Or, instead of doing the build remotely, you still have the opportunity to `git clone` the repository, and build it locally with the command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ahwxorg/librey.git
cd librey/
docker build -t librey:latest .
```

<br>

### Support for different architectures

Supported architectures for the official librey images include the same ones supported by Alpine itself, which are typically denoted as `linux/386`, `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm/v6`. If you need support for a different architecture, such as `linux/arm/v7`, you can modify the 'Dockerfile' to use a more comprehensive base image like `ubuntu:latest` instead.

In this case, you must run the `buildx` process specifying the desired architecture as shown in the example below:

```sh
docker buildx build \
    --no-cache \
    --platform linux/arm/v7 \
    --tag ahwxorg/librey:latest .
```

**OBS:** Keep in mind that this can cause some issues at build time, so you need to know a little about Dockerfiles to solve this problem for your specific case.
